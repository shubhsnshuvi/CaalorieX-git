## How to Add Images

3. Make sure to use appropriate image formats:
   - JPG/JPEG: For photographs and complex images
   - PNG: For images requiring transparency
   - SVG: For logos and icons that need to scale
   - WebP: For optimized web images (recommended when possible)

## Required Images

## Image Optimization

For best performance:
1. Compress your images before uploading
2. Use appropriate dimensions (don't use a 2000px wide image for a 200px space)
3. Consider using WebP format for better compression
4. Use SVG for logos and icons when possible
